    <h2>Bounties</h2>

    <p>
      Bounties from the mod are what you would expect to see from real bounties.
      Creatures around the world kill innocent people and you're the one who will
      kill them.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will see the <span>Bounty master</span> in your world. He is marked by
      a yellow exclamation mark with a white circle on your map and moves around the world as you progress through
      your save. So don't expect him to stay in the same spot. He's a wandering
      guy who likes to explore the world and searches for courageous Witchers
      to complete the bounties.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bounty masters accepts any <span>monster trophy</span> (from RER only)
      that you currently have in your inventory and buys them at a price merchants
      can't compete.
      <img src="index.html" alt="">
      The buying price can be edited in the <span>Rewards System / Trophies</span>
      menu. The default value of 55% is perfect for prices that are close to the
      lore and also the vanilla prices for trophies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever you approach the bounty master, he will buy your trophies but also
      start a dialogue about monsters you have to kill. If you wait for the end
      of the dialogue the mod will ask you to pick a seed, or if you have the
      optional feature to skip the window enabled, it will pick the seed 0 directly.

    <p>
      The seed of a bounty is what controls the randomness. Two bounties with the
      same seed result in the exact same bounty. Even on a different computer,
      which means you can share with your friends bounties you discovered as
      a challenge or simply because the seed results in a bounty that is hard/easy to complete.
      <br>
      If you're not interested in the seed stuff, the seed <span>0</span> results
      in a completely random bounty and two bounties with the seed 0 won't be the
      same.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also important to note that when you first install RER you only have
      access to lower seeds. And as you finish bounties you unlock new higher seeds.
      The higher seeds are also more difficult, you will see more groups of creatures,
      more creatures in these groups, creatures will also be bigger, but you will
      also get more rewards. Because the seed <span>0</span> is completely random
      the difficulty scales on Geralt's level instead to guarantee a smooth experience.
      It scales infinitely, so if you use a seed <span>1 000 000</span> the bounty
      will be incredibly hard or if you use a mod to get to level 300 and use the seed
      0, that bounty will also be hard.
      <br>
      Note that, at the moment of writing you unlock seeds by steps of <span>500</span> and difficulty
      increases by one point every <span>1000</span> in the seed you pick. So you're not going to
      play a bounty with a seed of one million any time soon!
    </p>

    <p>
      An important thing to note about the seed 0. As i said, the seed 0 bounties scale
      on Geralt's level so they're perfect when you're leveling. And for this reason
      the seed 0 bounties are the only bounties that use your settings. Which means
      that if you use the bestiary feature and you start a seed 0 bounty, creatures
      you have not killed yet won't appear in these bounties. The filter does not
      happen for bounties with seed different than 0, so you can see creatures you
      have not discovered yet. It also means it uses the region constraints, you will
      see region specific creatures only.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you've picked the seed and the bounty has started. You will notice skull
      markers on your map. The goal of a bounty is to kill every groups marked by
      these markers until there is no markers on your map. Because the game limits
      to 10 markers at a time, bounties show up only 5 groups maximum at a time
      and as you progress through the bounty new groups will be marked.

    </p>

    <p>
      You will be notified when you've completed the bounty. The mod will show
      a little notification and also tell you your new bounty level.

    <p>
      If you just want the bounty master to buy your trophies without starting a
      bounty. You can leave the conversation before it finishes and a bounty won't be triggered.
