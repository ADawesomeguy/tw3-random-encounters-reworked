    <h2>Contracts</h2>

    <p>
      RER contracts are mini contracts like you would see in vanilla. Of course
      they are not as detailed and you should not expect the exact same features
      as the RER contracts are randomly generated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contracts consists of small pre-built phases that are composed to make a full
      quest. The length of the contract is decided by the number of phases that are
      played. And the number of phases can be controlled by the longevity slider
      <img src="longevity.png" alt="">
      All phases have different longevity costs, phases where you simply asked to
      follow a trail, or where Geralt talks a bit cost less than phases where you
      will fight. What you need to know is that one longevity point equals around
      1 minute and 30 seconds of gameplay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contracts can appear naturally during gameplay based on the <a href="./index.html">frequencies</a> set
      without doing anything, or you can interact with any noticeboard in the game and if there is still room for
      it a random notice will be added. These notices are all signed by <span>A. Letoth</span> so you can recognise
      vanilla notices from RER's.

    </p>

    <p>
      Once you've done that, the mod will wait for you to leave the settlement or
      move away from the noticeboard. Then it will wait a bit longer and based on
      the path you walked, will finally start the contract.
      It uses the path you walked so <b>you</b> can decide where the contract will
      take place. It's useful if there is an area you don't like.
      <br>
      You will know when the contract started because a <span>camera scene</span>
      is played and Geralt will talk too.

      allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>

    <p>
      From there, just let yourself be guided by the map markers and the trails
      you see on the ground. You will know when a contract is over when Geralt
      says the line <span>It's over</span>

    </p>

    <p>
      You can now go back to a noticeboard and start a new one if you want.
