- Geralt: Lost the trail. Gotta look around for something else.
- Geralt: Damn it. Think I lost its trail.
- Geralt: Damn, trail breaks off. Could find something else, though.
- Geralt: Dammit, followed the wrong trail
- Geralt: Hmm, trail goes on. Good thing it doesn't end here.
- Geralt: Trail breaks off. Need to find another clue nearby, something else to follow.

## personal notes

### contract ideas
#### contract phases
- [starting-phase] corpse on the ground, player interacts with it and examines it
- [intermediary-phase] NPC asking for help, must help him and kill the monsters around him. Optional: npc is alive and gives you coins.
  - Von Gratz has good dialogues for that
	- Geralt choice: Don't have the time.
	- Geralt: Sorry. No time just now.
	- 0x0011c534    Geralt: Sorry. Gotta go.
	- 0x0011c530  Geralt choice: Sorryâ€¦ gotta go.
  -  0x0010a322      Geralt: Sorry, got more important matters to tend to.
  -  0x00055ca9    Geralt: Wish I could help.
  -  0x0011e3f1    Geralt: Arrived too late. Nothing I could do.
- [intermediary-phase] a lost NPC you can interact with, he gives you information on where to go
- [intermediary-phase] a mercenary you can pay to have him follow you for the rest of the contract
