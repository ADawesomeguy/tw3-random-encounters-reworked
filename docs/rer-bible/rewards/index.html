    <h2>Rewards</h2>

    <p>
      What would be the point of killing monsters, if you did not get any reward
      for it. RER adds new trophies with the sole purpose of being sold so that
      you can earn a few crowns from the monsters you killed. Because trophies
      may not sell much with any economy altering mods you use, it also includes
      an option for direct crown drops from creatures to compensate if you need it.

    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>Crowns</h3>
      In the crown settings, you control the base values for each encounter type.

      And then for each creature you control how much of the base value they drop in %.
      This value has some randomness you cannot edit, it varies by between 80% and 120%
      of what you set. So if you set 50% to the Sirens it will in reality vary
      between 40% and 60%
      <img src="crownpercent.png" alt="">
      This allows you to tell RER that Sirens should drop few crowns and also control
      the amount of crowns you get based on the encounter type. Some people do not
      want crowns outside of contracts so they set the <span>From ___</span> sliders to 0
      except for the <span>From contracts</span> slider.
      <br>
      Then you can tweak the amount dropped on a per creature basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>Trophies</h3>
      You can control from which encounters you get RER trophies with the first toggles.
      Creatures from an encounter with the trophies disabled won't drop trophies.

      You can also change the price of the trophies you get, but note it is not
      retroactive and won't change the price of the trophies you already picked.

    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, you can edit the chance for the creature to drop trophies.
      <span>100</span> means it has 100% chance to drop a trophy, <span>50</span> 
      means 50% and <span>0</span> means no trophies drop this creature.
