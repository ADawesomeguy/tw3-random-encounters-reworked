    <h2>Ecosystem</h2>

    <p>
      You can control which creatures you will see from RER with the ratio sliders
      in the menus. But there is also the ecosystem feature that changes what 
      creatures will be spawned.
      <br>
      The ecosystem feature integrate a food chain and relationships to the game
      so that whenever you let a creature live or you kill it, it completely changes
      the surrounding ecosystem and determines what creatures you will see the next
      time you come in the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a few options to control the ecosystem feature
      <img src="ecosystem.png" alt="">
      the <span>community diversity</span> controls how diverse your ecosystems will
      be. Higher values means you will see less diverse ecosystem, which will consist of
      less species. The ecosystems will be composed of dominant species and RER
      will often pick these one.
      <br>
      the <span>power spread</span> controls how much a species dominance spreads
      over the world. But it also works for dominated species where you killed most
      of its members. Higher values means the communities will spread over greater
      distances.
      <br>
      the <span>death speed</span> or death rate controls how many members of the
      communities die per generation. This slider is really important, it helps
      regulate the ecosystems and avoid over dominating species.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want an ecosystem with more impact on the spawn chances, i'd suggest
      to set values like (in respective order) <span>15</span>, <span>10</span> and <span>8</span>
