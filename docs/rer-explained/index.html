      <div>
        <h4>What is an ambush?</h4>
        <div>
          A monster ambush is when RER chooses a random creatures based on <a href="#part-4">external factors</a> and force
          the monsters to target the player no matter the distance at which they were spawned.
          Geralt is then ambushed by creatures who were created in his back so he could not see them come.

              You can set at which interval an ambush appears, it is a random value picked between two delays you set in the
              <span>Encounter frequency</span> menu. There you can tell the minimum interval between two ambushes and also the
              maximum delay.

      <h3>Encounter - Hunt</h3>

        <h4>What is a hunt?</h4>
        <div>
          A monster hunt is when RER chooses a random creatures based on <a href="#part-4">external factors</a> and force
          the monsters to follow an invisible bait. The creatures won't target Geralt unless he gets too close, they will
          stop following the bait for good and start attacking Geralt.
          The creatures from monster hunts leave foot tracks on the ground. There are many types of tracks, a human will leave
          boot prints while a spirit will create a fake fog around him.
          It is up to you to follow the tracks and kill the creatures

    <div>
      The Event System is different from the Encounter System because this time it is a set of actions that are triggered
      when you, the player, do something specific. For example there are events when you're hurt or when you enter an area.
      There are also events who do not need any player's action but instead will dynamically change the world around him, such
      as adding creatures to group of monsters

      Setting up the registry so Random Encounters Reworked get started automatically
    </blockquote>

    <div>
      <h3>Why do we need this?</h3>
      <div>
        As i said in <a href="#part-1-1">part 1.1</a> the bootstrap mod allows RER to start every time you enter the game. But you have to tell him where to look for RER, this is what you do with the registry.
        It may seem complicated but it's actually the simplest solution.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>How to update the registry</h3>
      <div>
        Go into <span>The Witcher 3/mods/modRandomEncountersReworked</span> and run <span>update-registry.bat</span> by double clicking it. Please always take a glance at a <span>.bat</span> file before running, by doing a right-click and edit, i know you may not be a programmer but it's a good habit and this one has comments explaining it. You never know üëç

      <h3>Keybind - Trigger an encounter</h3>

      <div>

        <div>
          When you press the key an encounter will be created by RER after a 5 seconds delay.

      <div>
        <h4>How to add it?</h4>

      <div>
        <h4>What is its role?</h4>
        <div>
          When you change the settings you usually have to load a save for them to be applied. This keybind solves this by forcing a settings refresh without the need to load a save.
