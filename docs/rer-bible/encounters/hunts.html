    <h2>Hunts</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="ambushes.png" alt="">
      Hunts, like any encounter have two menus for them. One for the day and one
      for the night. Useful if you want hunts during the day and none during the night
    </p>

    <p>
      First, you can control with the frequency slider how often you see hunts.
      <img src="frequency.png" alt="image showing the frequency slider">
      It is a ratio of all the frequency sliders from all the encounters, so if you set
      <span>5</span> to one and <span>50</span> to another it means the one with <span>50</span>
      has 10 times the chance to appear compared to the <span>5</span> one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you can control which creatures you see from hunts
      <img src="ambushes-settings.png" alt="image showing the hunt settings">
      These are ratios too, you don't have to calculate the exact % but you simply
      need to know that 100 is ten times more than 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from hunts roam the world freely and leave tracks on the ground.
      They don't directly go towards Geralt and simply mind their own business,
      until you get close enough.
