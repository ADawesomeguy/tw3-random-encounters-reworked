- `mh107` : "Mysterious Tracks"

# Ideas for encounters:
- Witcher hunters who try to kill Geralt,


# monster contracts

- `phase 1`: 
  - corpses on the ground,
  - Geralt talks like:
    - Died recently...
    - Should look around...
  - Tracks appear on the ground leading
  - Player follows them, can get ambushed while doing it.
    - could be humans telling "they won't need it now that they're dead!" (could use the dialogue from the )
  - `phase 1.b` It can also use "checkpoints", like the player found another place with corpses and it starts a new `phase 1`
- `phase 2`: 
  - spawn monsters, large or small
  - can repeat, if last spawn was not large monster
  - can go back to `phase 1`

What is important here are the dialogues, it would feel less impressive without them so before shipping anything
i must make sure there are enough dialogues to make it feel part of the base game.
