# monster contracts
> I want to add more phases or maybe new variants for already existing phases

Important note, the encounters currently has 4 phases:
 - Phase 0:   Clues investigate
 - Phase 1:   Clues follow
 - Phase 2:   Combat
 - Phase 2.1: Combat loop

I should not add too many phases, because if a contract plays all the phases
it may seem a bit too long. Adding one phase should be enough, the contract feels
a bit short sometimes.


## Starting phase
What i must absolutely add is a new way for the contract to start. It's the most
boring part and it's so boring it may even stop me from doing the contracts altogether

A new phase 0, so instead of investigating corpses and then following a trail there is
a mini phase where Geralt will simply kneel and examine a new trail that appeared nearby.
So there is a chance this phase will play. Which will simply skip the Clues Investigate phase

## Clues follow phase
I also want to improve the phase where Geralt follows the tracks. I once though
about adding an ambush mid-phase and i think it could greatly improve this phase

There are two ways i could do this, the first way would be to simply roll a dice
with low values frequently and start an ambush on a good roll.
But there is this idea i just got, what if for each seconds passed following clues
the timers for RER were all multiplied by two. This would increase the chances
to see any other encounters greatly, while following the tracks.
I could also use both ideas

## new variant
- phase 0: as soon as the contract starts:
  - play the kneeling animation on Geralt
  - play some oneliners about following the trail


- phase 0:
  - clues_investigate
    > the player sees the corpses on the ground and must find the trail among the blood
  - kneeling_animation
    > Geralt examining animation and a voiceline is instantly played without any user interaction

- phase 1:
  - None
  > there is a chance the player goes directly into the next phase
  - trail_choice
  > the player sees in front of him multiple trails and he has to pick one.
  > As soon as he pick one, the other trails are left as is and cannot be picked.
  > 
  - ambush
- phase 3:
  - combat
  - combat_loop

## voicelines i could use
- bodies were found here
- Trail ends here
- Must be the placeâ€¦
- Geralt: Looks like the place mentioned in the journal. Should search it.
- Geralt: I'll keep searching.
- Geralt: Lost the trail. Gotta look around for something else.
- Geralt: Damn it. Think I lost its trail.
- Geralt: Damn, trail breaks off. Could find something else, though.
- Geralt: Dammit, followed the wrong trail
- Geralt: Hmm, trail goes on. Good thing it doesn't end here.
- Geralt: Trail breaks off. Need to find another clue nearby, something else to follow.
- Geralt: Blood stains, barely visible. Someone was dragged this way. Someone who was still alive.
- Geralt: Bloodâ€¦ still fresh. He's close
- Geralt choice: Wonder why they split up.
- Geralt choice: Let's go back
