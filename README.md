# W3_RandomEncounters_Tweaks
[Witcher 3 Random Encounters mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/785?tab=description) Reworked. The original mod was not updated since a few years. Bugs fixed and performance improvements. Some new features coming soon

- Read [Installing](#installing) to see how to install the mod
- Watch the [videos](#videos) to see it in action

# What is it
It is not simply the old mod with a few bug fixes. I rewrote everything to serve as a base for my needs and the features i'll implement later-on. The only thing i kept from the original mod are the paths to the creatures templates.

This mod will add random encounters to your adventure in The Witcher 3. It can be humans attacking you or a monster wandering around while you're tracking him.

# Features & Changes
> I rewrote most of the logic for the mod before adding my features into it. The only thing i kept were the paths to the creatures templates. By doing so i managed to get everything working perfectly with (almost) no bugs. _Note that I am currently playing the game with my version of the mod_

- Simplified the mod menu, no more ground-encounter/group-encounter/human-encounter/flying-encounter. There is a single list of all the creatures available with spawning chances going from `0` to `100`. Of course if you set `100` to every creature they'll all have the same spawning rate in the end. So if you set Human to `100` and wolves to `20`, the humans have 5x more chances to appear.

- Every creature can (should) spawn, even basilisks, gryphons etc... They were not even implemented in the original version but still in the mod menu

- No more drop in framerate when a creature appears  (_at least on my computer ðŸ˜Š, even with 10 harpies everyting is running smoothly_). Everything is done asynchronously so we keep our sweet 60 frames per second and no longer know when we are ambushed. It was the main reason i wrote this because every time i had a freeze i _knew_ i would get attacked, defeating the whole purpose of the mod. 

- Each creature type has his [own spawn count based on difficulty](/src/templates.ws) to keep things balanced

- Each creature spawn has a chance of being a large creature encounter, a boss fight. The value can be changed in the mod menu.

## Videos

- [The Witcher 3 | Mod RandomEncounters reworked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR50xPzPtEs) showing large creatures spawning every 15 seconds.
- [The Witcher 3 | Mod RandomEncounters reworked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5X2bH3uIOw) showing large creatures hunts starting every 15 seconds.

## Features coming soon

- A group composition (i could not find a better name for it) is when an encounter is composed of different types of creatures. Like a giant fighting bandits, or a hunter attacked by wolves or even ghouls and drowners against you. 
  > note that i have a working proof of concept for this, but prefered waiting for it to be 100% ready

- A random event is when something you do triggers a creature spawn. You just killed a few bandits, well bad luck for you there are ghouls coming toward you now. Or you entered a forest and are fighting wolves, the noise attracted a hungry bear.

- (_more of a concept at the moment_) Improved AI, such as humans leaving a fight to go find other friends. This would work like the strongholds in blood and wine.

- Improved timer. I do not like how the spawning timer is a simple random value between to numbers at the moment. I plan to change how it work so the mod will react to events such as entering/leaving an area or fighting a type of creature.

## Missing features not implemented yet

- Removed the trophy system
- I can't understand how the localization works, you will find missing strings in the mod menu.

# Installing

1. The mod has two dependencies that you should install first :
    1. [modBootstrap](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2109/?)
    2. [modSharedImports](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2110/?)

2. Then take the [`/release`](/release) directory and drop its content (not the directory itself) in your `The Witcher 3` directory
3. Add the following line of code into `The Witcher 3\Mods\modBootstrap-registry\content\scripts\local\mods_registry.ws`
    ```rs
    add(modCreate_RandomEncountersReworked());
    ```
    so the file looks like this :
    ```rs
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    class CModRegistry extends CModFactory {
        protected function createMods() {
            // add mod creation calls here, like this:
            //
            // add(modCreate_<ModName>());
            // ...

            // see example dir
            //add(modCreate_ExampleMod());
            //add(modCreate_ExampleEntityMod());
            //add(modCreate_UiExampleMod());

            add(modCreate_RandomEncountersReworked()); // <-- you added this line
        }
    }
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```
4. Start the game, let it compile the new scripts and open the new mod menu to configure the mod as you want.
5. Done.
