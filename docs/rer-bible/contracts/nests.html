    <h2>Nests contracts</h2>

    <p>
      RER Nests contracts are simple, when you pick the nest notice on the board
      you will get a new marker on your minimap that will point to an area you should
      search. In that area you will find a nest that spawns monsters, your goal is
      to destroy the nest.

    <p>
      The nest will continue to spawn more creatures as long as it is alive. However
      after a certain time creatures will stop giving loot, and finally the nest will
      stop spawning anything.

    <p>
      During nest contracts you will only see small creatures.
