    <h2>Remains necrophages</h2>

    <p>
      The <span>remains necrophages</span> event simulates how necrophages are
      attracted to corpses you leave behind you. Whenever you kill a creature and
      it leaves stuff on the ground, there is a chance nearby necrophages will come.
      <br>
      This event only takes remains in account, so if you pick all the stuff from
      the ground, even the one you don't want and drop it back in a clean lootbag
      necrophages won't sense it.
