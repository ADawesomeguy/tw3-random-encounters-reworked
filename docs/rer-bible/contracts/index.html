    <h2>Contracts</h2>

    <p>
      RER will randomly inject notices on the noticeboard. These notices will tell
      the mod to start one of the few contracts it offers when you pick them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mod currently offers three types of contracts:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./trails.html">Trails contracts</a></li>
        <li><a href="./nests.html">Nests contracts</a></li>
        <li><a href="./hordes.html">Hordes contracts</a></li>
      </ul>
      And each one has its unique notice so that you can learn which notice leads
      to which type and pick only the ones you like.
