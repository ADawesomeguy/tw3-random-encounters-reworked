    <h2>Rewards</h2>

    <p>
      What would be the point of killing monsters, if you did not get any reward
      for it. RER adds new trophies with the sole purpose of being sold so that
      you can earn a few crowns from the monsters you killed. Because trophies
      may not sell much with the economy altering mods you use, it also includes
      an option for direct crown drops from creatures if you need it.

    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>Crowns</h3>
      In the crown settings, you control the base values for each encounter type.
      <img src="crownbasevalues.png" alt="">
      And then for each creature you control how much of the base value they drop in %.
      This value has some randomness you cannot edit, it varies by between 80% and 120%
      of what you set. So if you set 50% to the Sirens it will in reality vary
      between 40% and 60%
      <img src="crownpercent.png" alt="">
      This allows you to tell RER that Sirens should drop few crowns and also control
      the amount of crowns you get based on the encounter type. Some people do not
      want crowns outside of contracts so they set the <span>From ___</span> sliders to 0
      except for the <span>From contracts</span> slider.
      <br>
      Then you can tweak the amount dropped on a per creature basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>Trophies</h3>
      You can control from which encounters you get RER trophies with the first toggles.
      Creatures from an encounter with the trophies disabled won't drop trophies.
      <img src="trophiesfrom.png" alt="">

      You can also change the price of the trophies you get, but note it is not
      retroactive and won't change the price of the trophies you already picked.
      <img src="trophiesprice.png" alt="">
    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, you can edit the chance for the creature to drop trophies.
      <span>100</span> means it has 100% chance to drop a trophy, <span>50</span> 
      means 50% and <span>0</span> means no trophies drop this creature.

      <h3>Containers refill</h3>
      RER has always been about revitalizing old content, or places. This feature
      will refill the containers of regions where you kill monsters. From its
      description you probably think it won't work because you need to kill monsters
      for it to activate, and you rarely go back to old places just to kill monsters.
      Well, you're right but you may have forgotted about one of RER's key feature:
      <a href="../bounties/">the bounties</a>. The bounties force you to travel
      the world to kill dangerous monsters and collect valuable trophies.
    </p>

    <p>
      but anyway, the topic is not about the bounties here but the container but
      the containers refill feature. It's a pretty simple feature: you kill
      monsters, containers around you are filled with new loot. Obvsiously we
      all have a different view of balance, this is why this feature comes with
      a <i>few</i> (a lot of) sliders.
      <br>
      <img src="containerrefillpresets.png" alt="image showing the Default preset and the OFF preset">
      First, let's talk about the presets: the <span>defaults</span> preset that
      is applied automatically the first time you play with the mod; and second:
      the OFF preset to disable the feature.
      <br>
      <img src="containermainsliders.png" alt="">
      Now the main sliders:
      <ul>
        <li><span>chance to trigger</span> allows you to define the chance for
          it to happen after you kill an encounter from RER. Note that it only works
          for RER encounters.
        </li>
        <li><span>Only empty containers</span> by default the feature only works
          on containers that are empty to prevent filling the containers with tons
          of stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Radius</span>, it controls how far around the player RER will
          look for containers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Number of containers</span> tells the maximum of containers will
          be refilled everytime this system triggers. It is not guaranteed to
          reach this number if there are not enough containers around you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="containerloottablessliders.png" alt="Image showing the sliders for the loot tables">
      Each slider that starts with the little yellow dash is a loot table. Every
      time this system triggers it will randomly pick one loot table for each
      container (if you allowed more than one container per trigger) and then
      fill the container with the objects from the loot table.
      <br>
      The values you set to these sliders control the chance for the loot table
      to be picked. The value is like a ratio/coefficient, <span>15</span> doesn't
      mean this loot table will have 15% chance to be picked. Instead it means
      that it has half the chance to be picked compared to a <span>30</span>.
