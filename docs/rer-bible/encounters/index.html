    <h2>Encounters</h2>

    <p>
      Encouters in RER are random groups of creatures you will encounter in your
      world. These groups are spawned by RER around the player at random intervals.
      Each of these encounters have different behaviours and do completely different
      things, you can learn more by looking at their respective pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      As said earlier, encounters are spawned at random intervals. You can control
      this interval with the delay sliders in the <span>Encounters System / General</span>
      menu.
      <img src="delays.png" alt="image showing the two delay sliders">
      You can set different delays for the night and the day, particularely useful
      if you want encounters only during the night for example. In such case you'd
      set the day delays to a really high value like 600 seconds (10 minutes).
      <br>
      There are two sliders each time, the minimum and maximum delay because RER
      picks a random value between the two intervals. So with the settings shown in
      the image RER will pick create an encounter at an interval between 60 and 130 seconds
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also control how far encounters are created as encounters are spawned
      around you. The distance sliders help you control this
      <img src="distances.png" alt="image showing the three distance sliders">
      the first slider, the <span>minimum spawn distance</span> controls the distance
      at which encounters cannot be created. It is a safe radius around you.
      <br>
      The second slider <span>spawn diameter</span> is the danger zone after the safe zone
      where encounters are created. So with the settings shown in the image encounters
      will be created between 40 meters and 160 meters from you.
      <br>
      The last slider, the <span>automatic kill threshold</span> tells at which distance
      RER considers an encounter lost and kills it to save performances. Because it is
      not guaranteed creature from encounters will go towards Geralt, this slider is important.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from RER are always spawned at Geralt's level, it ensures a pleasant experience.
      But you can control their level with the levels sliders
      <img src="levels.png" alt="">
      It is pretty simple, with <span>lowest: -3</span> and <span>highest: 3</span> you will get creatures
      with a random level around yours but never higher than three levels and never lower than three.
      <br>
      You can set both sliders to <span>+10</span> and every creatures will be ten levels higher than you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Static encounters are so simple they don't deserve they own menu, so their
      spawn chance were set in this menu.
      <img src="staticencounters.png" alt="image showing static encounters sliders">
      If you want to learn more about them, see the static encounters page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from encounters may drop tracks on the ground, this slider controls
      how often they leave tracks and how dense the trails will be.
      <img src="trailratio.png" alt="">
      A value around
      30% will result in vanilla like trails where tracks are placed every few meters.
      While 100% will result in really dense trails that are easier to follow. But note
      that RER limits 200 tracks per entity and after the limit is reached it starts
      recycling old tracks to save performances. With really dense trails the entities
      will reach the limit really fast and you may see trails disapear in front of your
      eyes.
