    <h2>Hordes contracts</h2>

    <p>
      Hordes contracts, like the nest contracts, are simple. Once picked from a board
      the game will wait for you to leave the settlement to look for the nearby creatures
      that are causing troubles to the villagers. After some time you will see
      a bar showing you the progress of the hordes and monsters will quickly swarm you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your goal is to eradicate the horde and survive. If you die the contract is
      cancelled and you will have to pick the notice again.
